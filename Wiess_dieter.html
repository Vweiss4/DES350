	<h1>
	Interpretation A:
	</h1>
	<p>
	1. Good design is something that pushes boundaries and social norms.<br>
2. Good design should always have a use behind it. Nothing should be made for zero reason.<br>
3. The things we use every day interpret who we are as a person so it is important that it is something that can reflect us.<br>
4. If someone can not understand something it loses its purpose.<br>
5. Designs should leave room for a person to put their own self expression into it.<br>
6. Design is not something used to manipulate or lie to someone but instead to innovate and push what we know.<br>
7. Good design doesn’t go out of style, it is meant to last long and stay relevant for a long time.<br>
8. Detail is key. Everything should have a reason for why it is where it is.<br>
9. Design is important so that also makes it important that it is unobtrusive to the environment we live in.<br>
10. Less can always be more effective. The essentials and nothing else can show a form of purity.

	<h2>
	Interpretation B:
	</h2>
	<p>
	1. I see a lot of innovation in things such as survival equipment. For example tents that self heal punctures to the fabric.<br>
2. A spitting image of this is phones and computers. The amount of versatility this one device has really shaped our lives.<br>
3. Pretty much every product in todays age is targeted towards a type of consumer so in order to cater to that target audience the aesthetic is a key point.<br>
4. If something can let you know its purpose and how to use it just by looking at it you have successfully removed any chance of confusion leading to a persons choice. For example people are more likely to buy a full car rather than all the parts to build it themselves.<br>
5. Unobtrusive design can be seen a lot in necessary house utilities such as a fridge or sink. Which allows someone to decorate and shape the space around them with out it feeling like it doesn’t belong.<br>
6. Of course if something claims one function and doesn’t perform this causes a distrust. This is why most if not all products tend to be truthful in what they provide.<br>
7. Furniture is a great example of designs that are meant to last. Something as simple as my black computer desk with black metal legs is sleek yet simple enough to fit with any room design.<br>
8. Everything added has an impact on what people think about something so for example the addition of grooves to a spoon are not simply for looks but to add grip and comfort when handling.<br>
9. Although a lot of products don’t follow this principal it is important that products such as reusable water bottles allow us the same functionality as plastic bottles but help our environment tremendously by reducing waste.<br>
10. This relates to principle 8 that if something doesn’t serve a purpose it shouldn’t be there. most products follow this rule to not only reduce clutter but also cost.

	<h3>
		Interpretation C:
	</h3>
	<p>
		1. It is alright to take inspiration from other designers and designs but it should always be a factor of pushing it further in your own way.<br>
2. In my work I feel like everything has a certain underlining meaning even if at the time I don’t realize it.<br>
3. Everything in graphic design lends itself to a sort of style or aesthetic and that can be extremely useful when trying to get a point across.<br>
4. I feel like it can be beneficial to create things that people don’t understand because it forces them to think and question what they know or think they know about design.<br>
5. In graphic design I feel that sometimes it can be necessary to make something obtrusive to send a message.<br>
6. I feel in graphic design it isn’t right to create something that goes against ones beliefs or particular interest for personal gain.<br>
7. Designs should be timeless and no matter how long they have been around should give anyone who looks at it the opportunity to take something away from it.<br>
8. The same as product design nothing should have zero thought put into it. Everything is there for a reason.<br>
9. I feel that this doesn’t necessarily apply to design in a digital format but with ideas such as printing it is important to use recyclable materials in order to not harm the environment.<br>
10. In most cases yes design benefits from simplicity rather than visual clutter. I would also argue that this rule can be broken in certain situations with specific reasonings.
